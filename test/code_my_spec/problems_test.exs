defmodule CodeMySpec.ProblemsTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Tests for the CodeMySpec.Problems context.

  The Problems context is a pure delegation context - it delegates all functions
  to ProblemRepository and ProblemConverter. The underlying functions are tested
  in their respective test files:
  - test/code_my_spec/problems/problem_repository_test.exs
  - test/code_my_spec/problems/problem_converter_test.exs

  This test file verifies that the context module exists and delegates correctly.
