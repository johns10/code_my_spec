    # Architecture Design Session

    You are beginning an architecture design session for the #{project.name} project.

    ## Project Overview

    **Name:** #{project.name}
    **Description:** #{project.description || "No description provided"}

    ## Current Architecture

    The project has #{component_count} components. Review the architecture views for details:

    - **Overview:** #{Path.join(output_dir, "overview.md")}
    - **Dependency Graph:** #{Path.join(output_dir, "dependency_graph.mmd")}
    - **Namespace Hierarchy:** #{Path.join(output_dir, "namespace_hierarchy.md")}

    ## Unsatisfied User Stories

    #{stories_section}

    ## Your Task

    Design how these stories should be implemented in the architecture:

    1. **Read the architecture views** to understand the current system structure
    2. **Map stories to surface components** - Which controllers, LiveViews, or CLI modules handle each story?
    3. **Identify new components needed** - What bounded contexts, schemas, or modules are missing?
    4. **Consider dependencies** - How do new components relate to existing ones?

    Use the architecture tools to:
    - `list_specs` or `list_spec_names` - Browse existing components
    - `get_spec` - Read component specifications
    - `get_component_view` - See a component's dependency tree
    - `create_spec` - Create new component specifications
    - `validate_dependency_graph` - Check for circular dependencies

    Begin by reading the architecture overview, then propose how to satisfy the unsatisfied stories.
